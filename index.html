                Seattle, known as the Emerald City, offers travelers the perfect mix of urban activities
                and fantastic nature. With a fascinating and underrated history,
                there is also much more to Seattle than being the home of Starbucks.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will discover a city full of museums, bustling markets, interesting 
                cultural and historical attractions along with green spaces fed by the city’s 
                iconic rain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Easy to get around, you will be able to forego a rental 
                car to enjoy walking through town or exploring on the Monorail. 
                Although you may want a car to visit the nearby Olympic National Park, 
                you can also jump on a ferry to enjoy a day trip to the beautiful 
                Bainbridge Island instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seattle’s cafe culture is one of the strongest in North 
                America and each morning can begin with a hot cup of Joe that 
                will fuel endless adventures. From there the choice is yours, but 
                this helpful itinerary will have you exploring Seattle like a local.
            </p>

                neighborhoods showing off homegrown and international cuisine, a 
                downtown core full of history and atmospheric markets and an 
                envious selection of natural space, there are so many ways to enjoy Seattle.
