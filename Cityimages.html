        >Space Needle</a
      >
      quickly became an icon of the city that today is recognized far and wide.
      On the observation level, which you can reach via a 43-second elevator
      ride, see the doodle-on-a-napkin concept that led to the Space Needle
      design. Views from the top feature Elliott Bay, the Cascade Mountains, and
      even Mount Rainier.

      at the University of Washington. It is the most comprehensive collection
      of his art to date, with interior galleries featuring a variety of his
      work in the medium. The pièce de résistance is the glasshouse, with a
      vibrant 100-foot-long sculpture in hues of red, orange, and yellow
      suspended from the ceiling.
